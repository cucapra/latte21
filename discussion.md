Please add topics/questions you'd like to have discussed during the workshop.

- Challenges in end-to-end compilation (from "PyTorch to FPGA")
  - Meaningful error messages (What does "failed to route" mean for a C++ program)
  - Compilation times (What does `-O0` compilation look like?)

- Interface design and integration into larger Systems-on-Chip.

- Status and future of C based HLS tools
  - What is preventing wider adoption?
  - Are there any success areas?
  - Is C the right abstraction for HLS tools?

- Discussion on the open-source LLVM front-end of Vitis HLS tool.

- Future of FPGAs as accelerators vs. other technologies (e.g. GPUs).
  - How is HLS helping to popularise FPGAs? What still needs work? What comes after HLS?
  - How will technologies such as HBM2 affect FPGA performance/adoption?
  - Will "harder" concepts such as multi-FPGA, FPGA networking, and near-memory gain traction?
 
 - FPGA overlays and encapsulating hardware programmability for software developers.
