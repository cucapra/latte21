Please add topics/questions you'd like to have discussed during the workshop.

- Challenges in end-to-end compilation (from "PyTorch to FPGA")
  - Meaningful error messages (What does "failed to route" mean for a C++ program)
  - Compilation times (What does `-O0` compilation look like?)

- Interface design and integration into larger Systems-on-Chip.

- Status and future of C based HLS tools
  - What is preventing wider adoption?
  - Are there any success areas?
